No one likes filling out intake forms, they are often difficult to understand and fatiguing to complete.  These challenges are compounded when the users trying to complete the form are living with disabilities.  This project aims to understand and address the major pain points disabled individuals face when completing forms.

# Project Information #

## How we chose our platform ##

When designing this solution for the Alliance of People with disAbilities it was crucial to us that the Alliance would be able to maintain and edit their new online intake form, this forced us to create our intake form using a 3rd party form creator. The alliance also had budget constraints and as a result we were unable to use paid form creators.  With these two requirements, there were two solutions available to us Google forms and Microsoft forms, we decided to build our accessible form in Microsoft forms because Microsoft forms are HIPPA compliant, the Alliance already uses Microsoft products and Microsoft's Forms platform has many accessibility features built in.

## How we designed our forms ##

We used personas as well as interviews with future users at the Alliance to help us better understand our problem space and how we could design a form that delights our users.  In one of our interviews with a worker at the Alliance it was explained to us that intake meetings were taking up to four hours to complete, this was a result of the varying ability levels of the consumers and the form fatigue that they were experiencing due to their intimidatingly dense 6 page long intake form.  This discovery influenced us to group similar questions into sections and then space those sections over several pages. In addition to breaking the form into smaller cohesive pieces, we also created a progress bar to help consumers see how far they are in the form.  Since the majority of our users were going to have at least one disability we knew from the onset that our form would need to be accessible both by screen readers as well as through keyboard navigation and made sure to support the needs of those users.

## Our Iterative Process ##

After creating our first attempt at an accessible online intake form we did a lot of user testing carrying out a total of nine user tests, three of which where completed using Usertesting.com the rest were completed over zoom with individuals from the Alliance as well as potential consumers.  These tests were invaluable for us in our design of this form and opened our eyes to some of the issues with our current version.  With the exception of three user tests from Usertesting.com, edits where made to the form after every user test.

## Conversational language ##

We kept our questions friendly and sincere so that you feel the love from the Alliance even before you meet one of their amazing workers.

## Database Integration ##

Freeing up time extra time for the Alliance workers so that they can spend more time doing what they love, helping people, was one of the main goals of this project, a power automate flow keeps things running smoothly behind the scenes taking responses and saving them to an easy to upload format as soon as forms are submitted.

## Content clustering ##

Birds of a feather flock together, so do the questions on our form, we took the time to group all of our similar questions together.

# Project Status #

The project is ready to be handed to our sponsor, the Allaince. As we also discovered that our sponsor's third party database, [CIL Suite](https://www.cilsuite.com/), is working on similar project, we will provide them with our research findings for additional resources.
